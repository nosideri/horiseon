## Horiseon
​

## Description 

Horiseon is an online marketing agency that allows you to efficiently market your bussines to the correct audience, and manages what people are able to see if they look you up. It helps with cost management, brand awareness, and lead generation.

What motivated me to do this website was helping Horiseon have a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their own site is optimized for search engines.
